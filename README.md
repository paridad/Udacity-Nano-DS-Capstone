## Instructions for running Data Scientist Capstone Project Jupyter Notebook


1.	Load the Python notebook into local Jupyter or Cloud ML platform(e.g. SageMaker)

2.	Install **mixtend** using one of the following approaches:

        - Conda: conda install mixtend
        - from PyPI- pip install mixtend
        - Dev version: pip install git+git://github.com/rasbt/mlxtend.git â€“ I have used this method

3.	Pls. make sure to load the data to appropriate directory
       a.	Since I have used the Local Jupyter Notebook, I have uploaded the data into same folder as notebook.	But you may need to modify the code, if you need to store data in a different place

            # read in the csv file
            bank_data = 'bank_marketing_data.csv'


4.	Run the Notebook and review the result.
